BIG TESTER, INC.

PRIVACY POLICY

Big Tester, Inc. takes your privacy seriously. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our website and services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) describes the collection of your personal information by Big Tester from our website located at www.bigtester.com, including without limitation all sub-domains thereof on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the “Site”) and through your use of our products and services made available through the Site. This Privacy Policy also describes our use and disclosure of such information.

By accessing the Site or using the products or services made available through the Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The terms “Big Tester,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Big Tester or Big Tester Tebloud, Inc. The terms “you” and “your” refer to the user accessing or using the Site or the Services.

The term “Personal Information” as used in this Privacy Policy refers to personally identifiable information that specifically identifies an individual (such as an individual’s first and last name, address, telephone number, e- mail address, credit card or other account number), and information about that individual or such individual’s activities or preferences when such information is directly linked to personally identifying information. Personal information does not include aggregated information or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed and combined with others. We may collect, use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.

HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION.

We collect Personal Information from you in the following ways.

Via Registration. We collect the Personal Information you provide to us when you register for an account on the Site.

Via Correspondence. If you contact us by e-mail, using a chat box or contact form on the Site, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the Personal Information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.

Via E-mail Newsletters. We may offer e-mail newsletters from time to time on the site. If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address.

Via User Profiles. The Site may give you the ability to create and update a user profile. If we offer user profile functionality on the Site, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of creating or updating a user profile. This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you. We may indicate that some personal information is required to create the profile, while some is optional.

Via Interactive Site Features. The Site may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Site, to post comments to forums, to upload content (“User Materials”), to participate in surveys via the Site or e-mail, and otherwise to interact with the Site and with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on the Site that requests or permits you to provide us with Personal Information (including, for example, any features that allow you to post User Materials), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.

Via Contests and Sweepstakes. We or our business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on the Site. Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our business partners. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the business partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such Personal Information.

Via Passive Means Through the Site and Correspondence. When you visit the Site, some information is collected automatically. For example, when you access the Site, we may automatically collect (a) your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, (b) your browser type, (c) the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Site (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), (d) the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, (e) the website that you visited immediately prior to accessing the Site, (f) the actions you take on the Site, and (g) the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in on the Site. We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies and clear GIFs (also known as “web beacons”). We may use information passively-collected from the Site to administer, operate and improve the Site and our other programs, services, products, websites and other systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on the Site, and to provide advertisements and other content and an experience on the Site that is tailored to you. If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means from the Site with your Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means from the Site as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means from the Site in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form. Also, please be aware that third parties, such as companies displaying advertisements on the Site, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services, sites or content. We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.

Via Other Sources. We may receive information about you, including Personal Information, from third parties, and we may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Privacy Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose or transfer Personal Information about you to any third party unless we have your express permission.

Protecting our Interests.

Corporate Affiliates, Service Providers and Business Transfers. Big Tester may disclose or transfer your Personal Information (a) to its corporate affiliates (for example, a subsidiary or parent corporation), (b) to its service providers (like fulfillment, hosting, or payment service providers), but only for their use to provide the requested service or (c) to an acquirer or a successor or an assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. Big Tester requires its corporate affiliates that receive your Personal Information to limit their use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Big Tester requires each of its service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information disclosed or transferred by Big Tester to any such services provider.

Public Areas. You should be aware that any information you provide in blogs, forums or similarly non-private areas of the Site may be read, collected, and used by others who access these areas, and this information is not Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us regarding your use of the Site and any products or services made available through the Site.

When you visit the Site, you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other sites not operated by us (“Third Party Sites”). These Third Party Sites may also collect Personal Information about you. You should review the privacy po0licy of each such Third Party Site, as this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities or any information you disclose while using such Third-Party Site. We are not responsible for Third Party Sites, including without limitation their privacy policies. Our linking to a Third Party Site or otherwise making a Third Party Site available to you does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, such Third Party Sites.

HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

Big Tester uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access and unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. However, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will be absolutely protected. For example, your Personal Information may be affected by actions outside of our control, such as computer “hacking” and physical theft. You acknowledge that you provide your Personal Information at your own risk.
