6. INDEMNIFICATION.

6.1 Big Tester Indemnification. Big Tester agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Customer and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and contractors harmless from and against any liabilities, damages or expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim, demand, action, or proceeding initiated by a third party to the extent alleging that the technology underlying the Services, or any portion thereof, infringes such third party’s Canada patent, copyright or trademark or misappropriates such third party’s trade secret, provided that Customer: (a) promptly notifies Big Tester in writing of the claim, except that any failure to provide this notice promptly only relieves Big Tester of its responsibility pursuant to this Section to the extent its defense is materially prejudiced by the delay; (b) grants Big Tester sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) provides Big Tester, at Big Tester’s expense, with all assistance, information and authority reasonably required for the defense and/or settlement of the claim. In the event of a claim, demand, action or proceeding that the technology underlying the Service, or any portion thereof, infringes or misappropriates any third party intellectual property or other right or, if in Big Tester’s reasonable opinion, such claim, demand, action or proceeding is likely to occur, Big Tester shall have the right, at Big Tester’s sole cost and expense, to either: (i) obtain the right to continued use of the affected portion of the Services or (ii) modify or replace, in whole or in part, the affected portion of the Services to eliminate the infringement or misappropriation. If Big Tester is unable to achieve either of the foregoing in a commercially reasonable manner, Big Tester shall have the right to immediately terminate the Agreement upon written notice to Customer without liability therefor other than the refund of any Fees paid in advance by Customer. The provisions of this Section constitute Customer’s sole remedy and Big Tester’s exclusive liability related to the Services with respect to any infringement, violation, or misappropriation of any intellectual property right.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY.

7.1 Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any and all information that is disclosed by either party to the other party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, which if disclosed in writing or tangible form is marked as “Confidential,” or with some similar designation, or if disclosed orally or by inspection or observation, is identified as being proprietary and/or confidential at the time of disclosure and is confirmed as such in writing within 15 days of the disclosure. In the case of Big Tester, Confidential Information includes all information with respect to the Fees, including without limitation the amounts of the Fees and the payment terms. In the case of Customer, Confidential Information includes the Customer Data. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault of or breach of the Agreement by the receiving party; (ii) is rightfully known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (iv) the receiving party rightfully obtains from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure.

7.2 Use and Disclosure Restrictions. Each party agrees not to use the other party’s Confidential Information except as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under the Agreement. Except as otherwise permitted by the Agreement, each party shall not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to any third party except to those of its employees, and contractors that need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of the Agreement, provided that each such employee and contractor is subject to a written agreement that includes binding use and disclosure restrictions that are at least as protective of Confidential Information as those set forth herein. Each party will use all reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control, but in no event less than the efforts that party ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information of similar nature and importance. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other party: (i) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other party to contest such order or requirement or (ii) on an as-needed, confidential basis to its legal or financial advisors. In addition, each party may disclose the provisions of the Agreement: (a) as required under applicable securities regulations and (b) on a confidential basis to current or prospective investors or acquirers of such party.
